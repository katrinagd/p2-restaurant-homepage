> Goals:
          >> Be responsively designed using a mobile-first approach

          >> Be optimized for 3 screen sizes: mobile, min-width: 768px, and min-width: 1280px

          

 _Requirements:_

_Use the HTML5 doctype and semantic HTML5 mark-up_

_Incorporate an image slider using a jQuery plugin ( [bxSlider](https://github.com/stevenwanderski/bxslider-4))_

_Incorporate “smooth scrolling” into the menu that navigates to specific points in the page_

_Dynamically display whether the restaurant is open or not (based on the day of the week—the restaurant is closed on Saturday and Sunday) - using JavaScript_

_Incorporate custom fonts using @font-face_

_Use an icon font_

_Use CSS3 properties where appropriate (e.g. opacity or border-radius)_

_Use a pseudo-element to incorporate hover states for the links_
